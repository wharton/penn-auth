DEPRECATED: Django Wharton CoSign Login and Permissions
=======================================================

This module is deprecated, as Wharton/Penn no longer support CoSign.
====================================================================

We are leaving the code intact in case it helps anyone else still using CoSign (but you should be using Shibboleth like the rest of us).

Installing CoSign and setting up Apache
---------------------------------------
See [ISC's Apache Cosign instructions](http://www.upenn.edu/computing/weblogin/docs/apache_installation.html)
for step-by-step instructions.

Installing the Django app
-------------------------
Add this line to the requirements.txt of your Django project:

`git+https://github.com/wharton/wharton-cosign-auth.git`

An example requirements.txt is located in examples/. You can also install via pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/wharton/wharton-cosign-auth.git`

Middleware and authentication backends in settings.py
--------------------------------------
In order to integrate CoSign with the Django auth system,
we have to tell Django to use the `REMOTE_USER` server variable.
You can use `RemoteUserMiddleware` that ships with Django, or
the custom `PennRemoteUserBackend` from this module, which subclasses
`RemoteUserMiddleware` to remove password handling, since Cosign handles passwords during authentication.

Here is an example of this configuration:

```
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
)

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'wharton_cosign_auth.remote_user.WhartonRemoteUserBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'bootstrap3',
    'wharton_cosign_auth',
)
```

.htaccess file:

To protect your app using cosign and penn's login, you will need to add an .htaccess file to the root
of your application (this will essentially lockdown your entire app behind cosign):

```
CosignProtected On
AuthType Cosign
Require valid-user
CosignRequireFactor  UPENN.EDU
```

Logging out
-----------
To add a logout function to your urls.py, do the following:

```
from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
from django.contrib import admin

from wharton_cosign_auth.views import penn_logout


urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    url(r'^logout/', penn_logout, name='penn-logout'),
)
```

Using Built-in Permissions to Decorate Views
--------------------------------------------
wharton_cosign_auth gives you the ability to use view decorators using Wharton permissions.
Simply decorate a view by doing something similar to the following:

```
from django.http import HttpResponse

from wharton_cosign_auth.permissions import wharton_permission


@wharton_permission(['STAFF', 'WCIT'])
def my_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```

The decorator checks https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/api/v1/adgroups endpoint to see if the
user is in the supplied group(s).  If not, a 403 Forbidden will be returned.

Just make sure you pass a list (i.e. ['MKTG-STAFF']) even if you are only checking against one group.

Running Test Suite
------------------
To run the tests for wharton cosign-auth first make sure you have the correct dependencies installed. Then execute tests.py by navigating into wharton_cosign_auth

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd wharton_cosign_auth
python tests.py
```
